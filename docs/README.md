## docsify
> A magical documentation site generator.

## What is it
> docsify generates your documentation website on the fly. Unlike GitBook, it does not generate static html files. Instead, it smartly loads and parses your Markdown files and displays them as website. All you need to do is create an index.html to start and deploy it on GitHub Pages.

## See the Quick start for more details.
